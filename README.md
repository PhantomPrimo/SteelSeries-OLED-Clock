# SteelSeries - OLED Screen Clock
This is a Simple OLED Clock for Steelseries Apex Keyboards (Screen Size 128x40), was a bit disappointed this wasn't included as option in the SteelSeries Engine App so ended up making one myself.  

Example Display:

# Getting Started
1. Download the latest release build portable executable (`SteelSeries-OLED-Clock.exe`)
2. Place the exe in your Startup folder under `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` so it can auto start on Windows login
3. Start the exectuable (`SteelSeries-OLED-Clock.exe`), once it has started you should see a balloon notification stating its been minimized to tray.
4. Double Click Tray icon to open Graphical User Interface (GUI), 
   1. Once the GUI is open click Add Game this will add OLED Screen Clock to your SteelSeries Engine Apps tab.
   2. Next click Add Event to hook up the clock display to your keyboard
   3. Now you should see your clock display on the keyboard screen \o/
   4. If the display is not visible you may need to click Stop Clock and then Start Clock, if it still fails try closing the app from right clicking tray icon and restarting the app.

Also note that this is nothing official from SteelSeries, just a side project of a developer with too much time.
